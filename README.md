# rtfMRI Methods (a Dash application)

This site is an effort to make scientific data (in this case, methods implemented in real-time fMRI neurofeedback studies)
more **standardised**, **accessible**, **interactive**, **useful** and **open**.

It is currently an online companion to the research, 
*"Quality and denoising in real-time fMRI neurofeedback: a methods review"*, done by myself ([Stephan Heunis](https://jsheunis.github.io/)) and co-authors.
In future this framework will expand to cover not only denoising methods but also all other standard study parameters
(e.g. clinical population, sample size, neurofeedback substrate, etc) and outcome measures (BOLD response increase, symptomatic changes, self-reports, etc.)
The goal is also to include browsing, visualization and reporting functionalities for other modalities used in neurofeedback,
such as fNIRS, EEG, and MEG.
